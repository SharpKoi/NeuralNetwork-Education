# SproutNet

This project is for learning and education. It is not so efficient on training but clear and beginner-friendly.  

If you are currently studying deep learning or one who is interested at neural network, this project may help you to understand the algorithm behind neural networks.   

To see usage please read the `dnn_demo.ipynb`.  

  

**TODO**

- [ ] An article to introduce and explain neural network.
- [ ] An article to introduce and explain LSTM.
